<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle}>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is {identity.firstName}. This is going to be an exercise in expanding my digital footprint and learning in public. Some of my current hobbies inlcude the following (perhaps I will end up writing about some of them):</p>
    <ul>
      {
        identity.hobbies.map((hobby) => <li>{hobby}</li>)
        
      }
    </ul>
    <p>Professionally, I'm interested in creating more backend-focused projects and learning more about how to code closer to the machine.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of ideas that I am excited to write about soon!</p>
</BaseLayout>
